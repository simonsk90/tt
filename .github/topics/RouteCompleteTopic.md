## 1. Domain Concept

**Field Marking** is the process by which a TT robot physically marks a sports field
(pitch, court, track) using paint or chalk dispensed as it follows a GPS-defined route.

A **Route** represents the complete GPS path the robot must travel to mark one field.
The lifecycle of a route is:

```
Not Started → Working → Completed
```

The transition from `Not Started → Working` is triggered by `StartFieldMarking()`.
The transition from `Working → Completed` is triggered by `CompleteRoute()`.

There is no partial completion or pause state in this version of the domain.

---

## 2. Business Invariants

These rules are enforced inside the `Robot` aggregate. **They must never be relaxed or moved
to a service or handler.** Violation of an invariant raises `DomainException`.

### StartFieldMarking() Invariants

| # | Invariant | DomainException message |
|---|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | Robot MUST NOT be in `Working` status | "Robot '{Name}' is already performing a field marking operation." |
| 2 | Battery level MUST be ≥ 20% | "Insufficient battery ({level}%). At least 20% is required to start field marking." |

**Rationale for #2:** A robot that starts with less than 20% battery risks running out mid-route,
leaving the field half-marked. This would require manual cleanup and field closure.

### CompleteRoute() Invariants

| # | Invariant | DomainException message |
|---|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | Robot MUST be in `Working` status | "Cannot complete route for robot '{Name}' — route was never started." |
| 2 | `LastKnownPosition` MUST NOT be null | "Cannot complete route for robot '{Name}' — GPS data is unavailable." |

**Rationale for #1:** Completing a route that was never started is a logical impossibility.
This prevents ghost completions from stale background jobs.

**Rationale for #2:** The final GPS position is stored in `RouteCompletedEvent` and used
downstream by the statistics system and field management platform. A route without
a final position cannot be costed, billed, or logged.

## 3. State Diagram

```
           StartFieldMarking()
   Idle ─────────────────────────► Working
    ▲                                  │
    │         CompleteRoute()          │
    └──────────────────────────────────┘

   Error (reserved for future: GPS loss, obstacle collision, low-battery mid-route)
```

## 4. Complete Event Chain (Event-Driven Multicast Architecture)

This section describes the full lifecycle from API call to operator notification.

> **ARCHITECTURAL NOTE:** `RouteCompletedEvent` is multicast by MediatR to **two independent handlers simultaneously**.
> This is intentional — statistics and notifications are separate business concerns.
> A failure in one pipeline does not affect the other.

### Why multicast instead of chaining?

| Concern | Job Chaining ❌ | MediatR Multicast ✅ |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| Fault isolation | Stats failure blocks notification | Each pipeline fails independently |
| Open/Closed | Adding a new step requires editing `PushStatisticsJob` | Add a new `INotificationHandler<RouteCompletedEvent>` |
| Single Responsibility | `PushStatisticsJob` owns two concerns | Each handler and job owns exactly one concern |
| Testability | Jobs must be tested together | Each handler and job tested in isolation |

## 5. Domain Events Reference

### FieldMarkingStartedEvent

```csharp
record FieldMarkingStartedEvent(Guid RobotId, string RobotName, DateTimeOffset StartedAt)
    : DomainEvent(StartedAt);
```

- Raised by: `Robot.StartFieldMarking()`
- Consumed by: `FieldMarkingStartedEventHandler` (enqueues `TrackGpsProgressJob`)
- NOT persisted to any event store in this demo (outbox pattern: future work)

### RouteCompletedEvent

```csharp
record RouteCompletedEvent(
    Guid RobotId,
    string RobotName,
    DateTimeOffset StartedAt,
    DateTimeOffset CompletedAt,
    GpsCoordinates FinalPosition) : DomainEvent(CompletedAt);
```

- Raised by: `Robot.CompleteRoute()`
- Consumed by: `RouteCompletedEventHandler` (enqueues `PushStatisticsJob`)
- `Duration` property computed as `CompletedAt - StartedAt`
- `FinalPosition` is the last GPS reading before the route ended

---

## 6. Value Objects

### GpsCoordinates

```csharp
record GpsCoordinates(double Latitude, double Longitude)
```

- Latitude: [-90, 90] — validated in constructor
- Longitude: [-180, 180] — validated in constructor
- Mapped via EF Core `OwnsOne` with shadow columns `GpsLatitude`, `GpsLongitude`

## 7. Robot Aggregate — Property Reference

| Property | Type | Mutated by |
|----------|------|------------|
| `Id` | `Guid` | `Robot.Create()` only |
| `Name` | `string` | `Robot.Create()` only |
| `Status` | `RobotStatus` | `StartFieldMarking()`, `CompleteRoute()` |
| `BatteryLevel` | `double` | `UpdateBatteryLevel()` |
| `LastKnownPosition` | `GpsCoordinates?` | `UpdateGpsPosition()` |
| `FieldMarkingStartedAt` | `DateTimeOffset?` | `StartFieldMarking()` |
| `RouteCompletedAt` | `DateTimeOffset?` | `CompleteRoute()` |
| `DomainEvents` | `IReadOnlyList<DomainEvent>` | `RaiseDomainEvent()`, cleared by Infrastructure |

---

## 8. Extension Points (Future Work)

| Area | Current | Suggested Extension |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Error recovery | `RobotStatus.Error` defined, unused | Add `ReportError(string reason)` domain method |
| Mid-route battery | Not checked | Add battery telemetry subscription in `TrackGpsProgressJob` |
| Multi-robot | Single robot per command | Introduce `Fleet` aggregate or `IRobotFleetRepository` |
| Event persistence | In-memory SSE only | Implement outbox pattern with a `DomainEventLog` EF Core table |
| GPS fence validation | No boundary check | Add `FieldBoundary` value object and validate robot stays within it |
